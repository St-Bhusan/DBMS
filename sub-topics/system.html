    <h2>Definition and Examples of Software</h2>
    <p>
        <strong>Software</strong> refers to a set of instructions, data, or programs used to operate computers and execute specific tasks. It is the non-tangible component of computers, in contrast to the physical hardware.

        <li><strong>System Software:</strong> Operating systems like Windows, Linux, or macOS.</li>
        <li><strong>Application Software:</strong> Word processors (Microsoft Word), web browsers (Google Chrome), and media players (VLC).</li>
        <li><strong>Utility Software:</strong> Antivirus programs, disk management tools.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Definition of Domain Specific (Tailored) Software</h2>
    <p>
        <strong>Domain specific software</strong> (or tailored software) is designed to meet the unique requirements of a particular industry, organization, or user group. Unlike general-purpose software, it addresses specialized tasks within a specific domain.

    <h2>Definition and Explanation of Database Management System(DBMS)</h2>
    <p>
        A <strong>Database Management System (DBMS)</strong> is software that enables users to define, create, maintain, and control access to databases. It provides a systematic way to store, retrieve, and manage data efficiently and securely.
    </p>
    <p>
        DBMSs support data integrity, security, and concurrent access, and they abstract the complexities of data storage from users and applications. Examples include MySQL, Oracle Database, Microsoft SQL Server, and PostgreSQL.
