    <h1>Definition of Database</h1>
    <p>
        A <strong>database</strong> is an organized collection of structured information or data, typically stored electronically in a computer system. Databases are managed by database management systems (DBMS) and are designed to efficiently store, retrieve, and manage data.
    </p>

    <h2>Types of Databases</h2>
    <ul>

        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>NoSQL Database:</strong> Designed for unstructured or semi-structured data. Types include document, key-value, column-family, and graph databases. Examples: MongoDB, Cassandra, Redis.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Hierarchical Database:</strong> Organizes data in a tree-like structure. Example: IBM Information Management System (IMS).
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Network Database:</strong> Uses a graph structure to represent relationships. Example: Integrated Data Store (IDS).
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Object-oriented Database:</strong> Stores data as objects, similar to object-oriented programming. Example: db4o, ObjectDB.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Distributed Database:</strong> Data is distributed across different physical locations. Example: Google Spanner.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Cloud Database:</strong> Hosted on cloud platforms, accessible over the internet. Example: Amazon RDS, Microsoft Azure SQL Database.
