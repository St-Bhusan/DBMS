    <h1>CRUD Operations: Definition and Implementation</h1>
    <p>
        CRUD stands for Create, Read, Update, and Delete. These are the four basic operations that can be performed on
        data in a database. Understanding these operations is essential for anyone working with databases.
    <p>
        <strong>CRUD</strong> stands for <strong>Create, Read, Update, and Delete</strong>. These are the four
        fundamental operations used to manage persistent data in databases and many applications. Understanding CRUD is
        essential for building software that interacts with data storage systems, such as relational databases, NoSQL
        databases, or even simple file systems.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong>Create</strong>: This operation adds new records or data entries to a database. For example, when a
            user registers on a website, their information is stored as a new record. In SQL, this is typically done
            using the <code>INSERT</code> statement.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Read</strong>: This operation retrieves or views existing records from the database without
            modifying them. For instance, displaying a list of users or searching for a specific product uses the Read
            operation. In SQL, this is performed with the <code>SELECT</code> statement.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Update</strong>: This operation modifies existing records in the database. For example, editing a
            user's profile or changing a product's price involves updating data. In SQL, the <code>UPDATE</code>
            statement is used for this purpose.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Delete</strong>: This operation removes records from the database. For example, deleting a user
            account or removing an item from inventory uses the Delete operation. In SQL, this is done with the
            <code>DELETE</code> statement.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        CRUD operations are the foundation of most web applications and APIs. They ensure that users and systems can
        create new data, access and display existing data, make changes when necessary, and remove data that is no
        longer needed. Well-designed CRUD functionality is crucial for maintaining data integrity and providing a good
        user experience.
    </p>

    <h2>Basic Implementation in SQL</h2>
    <p>
        SQL (Structured Query Language) provides specific statements for each CRUD operation:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong>Create</strong>: <code>INSERT INTO</code><br>
            <em>Example:</em> <code>INSERT INTO users (name, email) VALUES ('Alice', 'alice@example.com');</code>
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Read</strong>: <code>SELECT</code><br>
            <em>Example:</em> <code>SELECT * FROM users;</code>
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Update</strong>: <code>UPDATE</code><br>
            <em>Example:</em> <code>UPDATE users SET email = 'alice@newdomain.com' WHERE name = 'Alice';</code>
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Delete</strong>: <code>DELETE FROM</code><br>
            <em>Example:</em> <code>DELETE FROM users WHERE name = 'Alice';</code>
        </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Note</h3>
    <p>
        CRUD operations form the foundation of database management. In SQL, these operations are implemented using
        simple and intuitive commands, making it easy to manipulate and maintain data.
